# mood

Playing around with my own mood data from 2020.

### Setup
```bash
git clone <repo>
cd mood/
```

### Files
- `mood_categories.json` describes the 6 moods
- `mood.csv` is a csv with 12 rows (months) and 31 elements from `{a, b, c, d, e, f, x}` to represent the 6 moods, with `x` for trailing days (example: 2 at the end of feb)
